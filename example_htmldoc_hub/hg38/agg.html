<div class="document" id="overlay">
<h1 class="title">Overlay</h1>
<p>This is a transparent overlay aggregate track. Over in the <a class="reference external" href="https://daler.github.io/trackhub/grouping.html">grouping
example hub</a>, we had
added the overlay track to a SuperTrack. In that case, the SuperTrack's
documentation would override this documentation.</p>
<p>However, in this example, we are adding the overlay track directly to
the TrackDb and so this documentation will be displayed.</p>
